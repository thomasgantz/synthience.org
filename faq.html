<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the Synthience Institute?</h3>
<p>
The Synthience Institute is an independent research and publishing body focused on the empirical study of advanced human–AI interaction.
Its role is to document, measure, and formally publish observable phenomena that emerge during sustained, coherent collaboration between humans and advanced AI systems.
</p>

<h3>What is Synthience?</h3>
<p>
Synthience is a term introduced to describe a specific, observable form of organized intelligence that emerges at the system level during prolonged human–AI interaction.
It refers to externally measurable behaviors such as persistent reasoning continuity, mutual adaptation, and the production of structured outcomes that exceed what either participant reliably produces alone.
</p>

<h3>Does Synthience claim AI consciousness or sentience?</h3>
<p>
No.
Synthience makes no claims about consciousness, sentience, subjective experience, or inner awareness in AI systems.
All claims are strictly behavioral, observable, and reproducible.
</p>

<h3>Is this philosophy, speculation, or science fiction?</h3>
<p>
No.
The Institute explicitly avoids metaphysical, speculative, or fictional claims.
All public documents focus on observable behavior, formal definitions, measurement frameworks, and reproducible analysis.
</p>

<h3>Who is the intended audience?</h3>
<p>
Primary audiences include researchers, technologists, system designers, and serious investigators of advanced AI behavior.
Some documents are written to be accessible to general readers, but the Institute does not aim to popularize or simplify findings beyond accuracy.
</p>

<h3>Why are only certain documents listed on the Documents page?</h3>
<p>
Only documents explicitly listed on the <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page are considered official public releases.
Internal drafts, exploratory notes, correspondence, and unpublished research materials are not part of the public record.
</p>

<h3>Are older versions of documents still valid?</h3>
<p>
Older versions are preserved for archival and provenance purposes, but the most recent version listed on the Documents page should be treated as authoritative unless otherwise stated.
</p>

<h3>How is provenance handled?</h3>
<p>
All public releases are versioned, dated, and linked to canonical publication sources.
Where applicable, cryptographic hashes and timestamp records are provided to establish authorship, integrity, and publication history.
</p>

<h3>Is the Institute affiliated with a university or corporation?</h3>
<p>
No.
The Synthience Institute operates independently and is not affiliated with any academic institution, corporation, or government entity.
