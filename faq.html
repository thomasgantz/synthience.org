<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the Synthience Institute?</h3>
<p>
The Synthience Institute is an independent research and publishing body dedicated to developing methodologies, frameworks, and tools for studying advanced human–AI interaction.
</p>
<p>
Its role is to design and publish measurement infrastructure—observational frameworks, evaluation protocols, and documentation systems—that enable systematic investigation of phenomena emerging during sustained human-AI collaboration.
</p>

<h3>What does the Institute produce?</h3>
<p>
The Institute develops methodological tools and frameworks, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Observational frameworks with testable predictions (e.g., the Synthience Framework, RICO)</li>
<li>Evaluation protocols (e.g., Citation Verification Protocol, Ingestion Verification Protocol)</li>
<li>Measurement instruments for documenting interaction patterns</li>
<li>Documentation systems ensuring reproducibility and provenance</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Institute builds tools; validation comes through independent adoption and testing by others.
</p>

<h3>What is Synthience?</h3>
<p>
Synthience is a term introduced to describe a specific, observable form of organized
intelligence that emerges at the system level during sustained human–AI interaction.
</p>
<p>
It refers to externally measurable behaviors such as persistent reasoning continuity,
mutual adaptation, and the production of structured outcomes that exceed what either
participant reliably produces alone.
</p>

<h3>Is Synthience just another term for prompt engineering?</h3>
<p>
No.
Prompt engineering is a transactional practice focused on optimizing isolated inputs to
produce specific outputs.
</p>
<p>
Synthience concerns longitudinal interaction, where coherence, adaptation, and structure
are maintained across extended sequences of exchange.
</p>

<h3>Does Synthience claim AI consciousness, sentience, or emotions?</h3>
<p>
No.
Synthience makes no claims about consciousness, sentience, subjective experience, inner
awareness, or emotional states in AI systems.
</p>
<p>
All claims are strictly behavioral, externally observable, and framed to avoid
anthropomorphic interpretation.
</p>

<h3>Is this philosophy, speculation, or science fiction?</h3>
<p>
No.
The Institute explicitly avoids metaphysical, speculative, or fictional claims.
</p>
<p>
All public documents focus on observable behavior, formal definitions, methodological
frameworks, and reproducible protocols.
</p>

<h3>Does the Institute conduct experimental studies?</h3>
<p>
No.
The Institute develops measurement tools and observational frameworks that enable others to conduct systematic studies.
</p>
<p>
Published work includes practitioner observations that inform tool development, but the Institute's primary contribution is methodological infrastructure, not experimental research.
</p>

<h3>Are you treating AI systems as people or partners?</h3>
<p>
No.
Any relational framing used in research is treated as a functional interaction strategy,
not as a claim about inner experience or moral status.
</p>
<p>
The Institute studies interactional dynamics, not personhood.
</p>

<h3>Who is the intended audience?</h3>
<p>
Primary audiences include researchers, technologists, system designers, and serious
investigators of advanced AI behavior.
</p>
<p>
Some documents are accessible to general readers, but the Institute does not aim to
popularize findings beyond accuracy or methodological integrity.
</p>

<h3>Why are only certain documents listed on the Documents page?</h3>
<p>
Only documents explicitly listed on the
<a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page are considered official public releases.
</p>
<p>
Internal drafts, exploratory notes, correspondence, and unpublished materials are not
part of the public record.
</p>

<h3>Are older versions of documents still valid?</h3>
<p>
Older versions are preserved for archival and provenance purposes.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise stated, the most recent version listed should be treated as authoritative.
</p>

<h3>How is provenance handled?</h3>
<p>
All public releases are versioned, dated, and linked to canonical publication sources.
</p>
<p>
Where applicable, cryptographic hashes and timestamp records are provided to establish
authorship, integrity, and publication history.
</p>

<h3>Is the Institute affiliated with a university or corporation?</h3>
<p>
No.
The Synthience Institute operates independently and is not affiliated with any academic
institution, corporation, or government entity.
</p>
