# synthience.org

Official public website of the Synthience Institute.

This repository contains the source for the Institute’s canonical public index
and navigation layer, hosted via GitHub Pages at:

https://synthience.org

---

## Purpose

The Synthience Institute website serves as the authoritative public entry point
for:

- Published definitions
- Public research releases
- Methodological documents
- Cryptographic provenance records

The site does not function as a primary publication archive. Instead, it
provides stable navigation, contextual framing, and cross-linking to canonical
publication and archival systems.

---

## Publication Model

Authoritative publication and citation records for individual documents are
maintained via external archival systems:

- **Zenodo** — DOI-backed publication and citation records  
  https://zenodo.org/communities/synthience-institute/

- **Internet Archive** — Long-term public preservation and historical snapshots  
  https://archive.org

This repository mirrors only the website source. Released documents themselves
are not stored here unless required for provenance mirroring.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository includes:

- Static site pages (HTML, CSS)
- Navigation and document index logic
- Public-facing explanatory content
- Links to canonical records and archives

It intentionally excludes unpublished drafts, internal working materials, and
non-released research artifacts.

---

## Provenance and Integrity

All public releases referenced by the site are versioned, dated, and linked to
cryptographically verifiable records where applicable.

The website should be treated as a **navigation and index layer**, not as a
substitute for authoritative archives.
