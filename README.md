**Official public website of the Synthience Institute**

This repository contains the source for the Institute’s canonical public index and navigation layer, hosted via **GitHub Pages** at:

👉 **https://synthience.org**

---

## Overview

The Synthience Institute website serves as the authoritative public entry point for the Institute’s work.  
It is designed to provide **orientation, structure, and traceability**, not to function as a primary publication archive.

---

## Purpose

The site provides access to:

- **Published definitions**
- **Public research releases**
- **Methodological and protocol documents**
- **Cryptographic provenance records**

Its role is to act as a **stable navigation and context layer**, linking readers to authoritative publication and archival systems.

---

## Publication Model

Authoritative publication and citation records are maintained externally:

- **Zenodo**  
  DOI-backed publication and citation records  
  https://zenodo.org/communities/synthience-institute/

- **Internet Archive**  
  Long-term public preservation and historical snapshots  
  https://archive.org

This repository mirrors only the **website source**.  
Released documents themselves are not stored here unless required for provenance mirroring.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository includes:

- Static site pages (HTML, CSS)
- Navigation and document index logic
- Public-facing explanatory content
- Links to canonical records and external archives

It intentionally excludes:

- Unpublished drafts
- Internal working materials
- Non-released research artifacts

---

## Use of GitHub

This repository is **not** an open-source collaboration project.

GitHub is used here as:

- A transparent, version-controlled source for the public website
- A stable reference point for navigation and explanatory materials
- A provenance mirror enabling inspection of changes over time

It is **not** intended for:

- Forking
- Pull requests
- Community modification

Authoritative research documents are published via **Zenodo** and preserved via **Internet Archive**.

---

## Provenance and Integrity

All public releases referenced by the site are:

- Versioned
- Dated
- Linked to cryptographically verifiable records where applicable

The website should be treated strictly as a **navigation and index layer**, not as a substitute for authoritative archives.
