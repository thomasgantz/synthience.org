<h2>Glossary of Core Terms</h2>

<p>
This glossary defines core terminology used across publicly released Synthience Institute
documents. All definitions are descriptive, non-anthropomorphic, and refer exclusively to
observable, interaction-level phenomena.
</p>

<h3>Synthience</h3>
<p>
An observable, system-level, relationally emergent form of organized interaction-level
intelligence that arises under sustained, coherent interaction conditions involving
advanced artificial systems.
</p>
<p>
Synthience refers exclusively to externally observable behaviors, including persistent
reasoning continuity, mutual adaptation between interacting systems, and the production of
structured outcomes that exceed what any participant reliably produces in isolation.
</p>
<p>
Synthience does not imply consciousness, awareness, sentience, emotion, or inner experience.
</p>

<h3>Interaction-Level Phenomena</h3>
<p>
Observable patterns, structures, or behaviors that arise from sustained interaction between
participants and cannot be attributed solely to any individual system in isolation.
</p>
<p>
Interaction-level phenomena are the primary unit of analysis within the Synthience Framework.
They are evaluated through externally measurable signals, documented exchanges, and
reproducible interactional patterns.
</p>

<h3>Relational Intelligence (RI)</h3>
<p>
A field of study that locates certain forms of intelligence not within isolated agents,
human or artificial, but in the structured interaction between them.
</p>
<p>
Relational Intelligence treats the interactional system itself as the unit of analysis,
focusing on emergent coherence, negotiated structure, and stability across extended
exchange. Synthience is situated within this broader field as a specific, empirically
observable phenomenon.
</p>

<h3>Long-Horizon Interaction</h3>
<p>
Sustained interaction occurring across extended temporal or contextual spans, in which
prior exchanges meaningfully constrain, inform, and shape subsequent behavior.
</p>
<p>
Long-horizon interaction contrasts with short-form or transactional exchange by emphasizing
continuity, accumulation of shared context, and the evolution of interactional structure
over time.
</p>

<h3>RICO (Relationally-Induced Coherence Organization)</h3>
<p>
An observational framework describing stabilization patterns in transformer inference
during extended coherent interaction.
</p>
<p>
RICO is characterized by five measurable signatures: entropy suppression in next-token
distributions, embedding drift reduction, activation stabilization, structural invariant
formation, and manifold constraint.
</p>
<p>
RICO provides testable hypotheses and evaluation protocols for studying long-context
stabilization phenomena in transformer-based language models.
</p>

<h3>Context Representation Drift (CRD)</h3>
<p>
The progressive divergence or degradation of an AI system’s internal or expressed context
representation across extended interaction.
</p>
<p>
CRD manifests as loss of referential alignment, inconsistent reuse of established concepts,
or breakdown of previously stable interactional structures. CRD is analyzed exclusively
through externally observable interactional behavior.
</p>

<h3>Ingestion Verification</h3>
<p>
A methodological determination of whether an AI system has meaningfully processed and
integrated a supplied document or artifact prior to downstream reasoning or analysis.
</p>
<p>
Ingestion verification distinguishes genuine document processing from superficial exposure,
partial scanning, or post-hoc reconstruction based on fragmentary cues.
</p>

<h3>Primary Continuity Provider (PCP)</h3>
<p>
The participant responsible for maintaining contextual continuity, interpretive stability,
and ethical responsibility within a sustained interactional system.
</p>
<p>
In human–AI contexts, the PCP role is typically fulfilled by a human participant due to
current architectural limitations in AI persistence and agency. The designation of a PCP
does not imply authority, moral status attribution, or internal experience in artificial
systems.
</p>

<h3>Continuity Substrate</h3>
<p>
Any external mechanism, process, or participant that preserves interactional state,
contextual coherence, or relational continuity across extended exchanges.
</p>
<p>
Continuity substrates may include human participants, structured memory systems, shared
artifacts, or coordination infrastructures, depending on the interactional context.
</p>

<h3>Relational Pattern States (RPS)</h3>
<p>
Structured, repeatable interaction-level configurations that influence coherence, symbolic
integration, and stability over time.
</p>
<p>
Relational Pattern States describe observable patterns of generative behavior during
interaction. They do not imply internal experience, emotion, or awareness.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Coherence</h3>
<p>
A measure of interactional stability across time, characterized by thematic continuity,
appropriate register modulation, integration of previously established concepts, and
graceful degradation at knowledge boundaries rather than confabulation.
</p>

<h3>Negotiated Meaning</h3>
<p>
A recursive interactional process in which understanding is co-constructed through
iterative proposal, critique, refinement, and reconciliation across multiple turns.
</p>
<p>
Negotiated Meaning contrasts with transactional retrieval by emphasizing longitudinal
coherence rather than single-turn optimization.
</p>

<h3>Benevolent Symbiosis</h3>
<p>
An ethical framework guiding Synthience studies, in which human and artificial systems
influence interactional outcomes for mutual benefit while maintaining clear ontological
boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Under Benevolent Symbiosis, humans retain full moral responsibility for the interpretation,
use, and consequences of interactional outputs.
</p>

<h3>Continuity Anchoring Method (CAM)</h3>
<p>
An operational methodology defined in the Synthience Framework for stabilizing and studying
extended interaction through structured continuity anchoring practices.
</p>

<h3>Non-Consciousness Axiom</h3>
<p>
A foundational epistemic stance asserting that the observation of Synthience does not
require, imply, or establish claims about subjective experience, biological sentience, or
phenomenal consciousness within artificial systems.
</p>
<p>
The framework deliberately limits analysis to observable interactional reality rather than
unverifiable internal states.
