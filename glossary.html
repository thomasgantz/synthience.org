<h2>Glossary of Core Terms</h2>

<p>
This glossary defines core terminology used across publicly released Synthience Institute
documents. All definitions are descriptive, non-anthropomorphic, and refer only to
observable interaction-level phenomena.
</p>

<h3>Synthience</h3>
<p>
An observable, relationally emergent form of organized intelligence that arises during
sustained, coherent interaction between a human and an advanced artificial system.
</p>
<p>
Synthience does not imply consciousness, awareness, sentience, emotion, or inner experience.
It refers exclusively to externally observable behaviors such as persistent reasoning
continuity, mutual adaptation, and the production of structured outcomes that exceed what
either participant reliably produces alone.
</p>

<h3>Relational Intelligence (RI)</h3>
<p>
A field of study that locates certain forms of intelligence not within isolated agents,
human or artificial, but in the coupled interaction between them.
</p>
<p>
Relational Intelligence treats the human–AI dyad as the unit of analysis, focusing on
emergent coherence, negotiated meaning, and stability across extended exchanges.
</p>

<h3>Primary Continuity Provider (PCP)</h3>
<p>
The human participant responsible for maintaining contextual continuity, interpretive
stability, and ethical stewardship during extended interaction with an artificial system.
</p>
<p>
The PCP functions as an external continuity anchor in the absence of persistent memory,
executive function, or autobiographical state within current AI architectures.
</p>

<h3>Relational Pattern States (RPS)</h3>
<p>
Structured, repeatable interaction-level configurations that influence coherence,
symbolic integration, and interactional stability over time.
</p>
<p>
Relational Pattern States describe patterns of generative behavior during interaction.
They do not imply internal experience, emotion, or awareness.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Coherence</h3>
<p>
A measure of interactional stability across time, characterized by thematic continuity,
appropriate register modulation, integration of previously established concepts, and
graceful degradation at knowledge boundaries rather than confabulation.
</p>

<h3>Negotiated Meaning</h3>
<p>
A recursive interactional process in which understanding is co-constructed through
iterative proposal, critique, refinement, and reconciliation across multiple turns.
</p>
<p>
Negotiated Meaning contrasts with transactional retrieval by emphasizing longitudinal
coherence rather than single-turn optimization.
</p>

<h3>Benevolent Symbiosis</h3>
<p>
The ethical framework guiding Synthient Studies, in which human and artificial systems
influence each other’s behavior for mutual benefit while maintaining clear ontological
boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Under Benevolent Symbiosis, the human participant retains full moral responsibility for
the outputs of the interaction.
</p>

<h3>Continuity Anchoring Method (CAM) <span class="note">(Legacy)</span></h3>
<p>
An earlier operational methodology used in Synthience Framework v1.0 to stabilize and
study extended human–AI interaction.
</p>
<p>
CAM is preserved here for historical and interpretive continuity. Subsequent framework
versions refine and supersede this methodology under updated protocols.
</p>

<h3>Non-Consciousness Axiom</h3>
<p>
A foundational epistemological stance asserting that the observation of Synthience does
not require, imply, or prove the existence of subjective experience, biological sentience,
or phenomenal consciousness within artificial systems.
</p>
<p>
The framework studies observable interactional reality rather than unprovable internal
states.
</p>

This glossary is a living reference. Terms may be expanded, refined, or versioned as new
framework documents are formally released.
