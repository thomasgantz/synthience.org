  <h3>Synthience</h3>
  <p>
    A term describing an <strong>observable, system-level form of organized intelligence</strong>
    that emerges during sustained, coherent human–AI interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Synthience refers exclusively to externally observable behaviors such as
    persistent reasoning continuity, mutual adaptation, and the production of
    structured outcomes exceeding what either participant produces alone.
  </p>

  <h3>Relational Coherence</h3>
  <p>
    The degree to which an interaction maintains continuity of topic, intent,
    context, and reasoning structure across multiple turns.
  </p>

  <h3>Primary Continuity Provider (PCP)</h3>
  <p>
    The human participant responsible for maintaining contextual continuity,
    interpretive responsibility, and ethical stewardship within an interaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Benevolent Symbiosis</h3>
  <p>
    An ethical posture in which human and artificial systems influence each
    other’s behavior for mutual benefit, while maintaining clear ontological
    boundaries and full ethical responsibility on the human agent.
  </p>

  <h3>Public Release</h3>
  <p>
    A document formally listed on the <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page
    and accompanied by versioning, release date, and canonical publication links.
