<h2>Glossary of Core Terms</h2>

<p>
This glossary defines core terminology used across publicly released Synthience Institute
documents. All definitions are descriptive, non-anthropomorphic, and refer exclusively to
observable, interaction-level phenomena.
</p>

<h3>Synthience</h3>
<p>
An observable, system-level pattern of organized interactional coherence that can arise
under sustained, structured interaction conditions involving advanced artificial systems.
</p>
<p>
Synthience refers exclusively to externally observable behaviors, including reasoning
continuity, mutual adaptation across exchanges, and the production of structured outcomes
that depend on extended interaction rather than isolated responses.
</p>
<p>
Synthience does not imply consciousness, awareness, sentience, emotion, agency, or inner
experience.
</p>

<h3>Interaction-Level Phenomena</h3>
<p>
Observable patterns, structures, or behaviors that arise from sustained interaction between
participants and cannot be attributed solely to any individual system in isolation.
</p>
<p>
Interaction-level phenomena are the primary unit of analysis within the Synthience
Framework and are evaluated through externally measurable signals, documented exchanges,
and reproducible interactional patterns.
</p>

<h3>Relational Intelligence (RI)</h3>
<p>
An analytical orientation that examines how certain forms of coherence, structure, or
problem-solving capacity arise from interaction between systems rather than from isolated
agents.
</p>
<p>
Within Synthience Institute publications, Relational Intelligence is treated as a descriptive
lens rather than a claim about internal cognition or a formally established discipline.
</p>

<h3>Long-Horizon Interaction</h3>
<p>
Sustained interaction occurring across extended temporal or contextual spans, in which
prior exchanges meaningfully constrain, inform, and shape subsequent behavior.
</p>
<p>
Long-horizon interaction emphasizes continuity, accumulation of shared context, and the
evolution of interactional structure over time.
</p>

<h3>RICO (Relationally-Induced Coherence Organization)</h3>
<p>
An observational framework describing externally measurable stabilization patterns in
transformer-based systems during extended coherent interaction.
</p>
<p>
RICO is characterized by repeatable behavioral signatures observed in interaction, such as
reduced contradiction, improved referential consistency, stabilized conceptual reuse, and
structured response evolution across turns.
</p>
<p>
RICO provides testable hypotheses and evaluation protocols grounded in observable outputs,
without reliance on privileged access to internal model states.
</p>

<h3>Context Representation Drift (CRD)</h3>
<p>
The progressive divergence or degradation of an AI system’s expressed context across
extended interaction.
</p>
<p>
CRD manifests as loss of referential alignment, inconsistent reuse of established concepts,
or breakdown of previously stable interactional structures. CRD is analyzed exclusively
through externally observable behavior.
</p>

<h3>Ingestion Verification</h3>
<p>
A methodological determination of whether an AI system has meaningfully processed and
integrated a supplied document or artifact prior to downstream reasoning or analysis.
</p>
<p>
Ingestion verification distinguishes genuine document processing from superficial exposure,
partial scanning, or post-hoc reconstruction based on fragmentary cues.
</p>

<h3>Primary Continuity Provider (PCP)</h3>
<p>
The human participant responsible for maintaining contextual continuity, interpretive
stability, and ethical responsibility within a sustained interactional system.
</p>
<p>
The PCP role reflects current architectural limitations in AI persistence and agency and
does not imply authority, moral status attribution, or internal experience in artificial
systems.
</p>

<h3>Continuity Substrate</h3>
<p>
Any external mechanism, process, or participant that preserves interactional state,
contextual coherence, or relational continuity across extended exchanges.
</p>
<p>
Continuity substrates may include human participants, structured memory systems, shared
artifacts, or coordination infrastructures, depending on the interactional context.
</p>

<h3>Relational Pattern States (RPS)</h3>
<p>
Structured, repeatable interaction-level configurations that influence coherence,
symbolic integration, and stability over time.
</p>
<p>
Relational Pattern States describe observable generative behavior during interaction and do
not imply internal experience, emotion, or awareness.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Coherence</h3>
<p>
A measure of interactional stability across time, characterized by thematic continuity,
appropriate register modulation, integration of previously established concepts, and
graceful degradation at knowledge boundaries rather than confabulation.
</p>

<h3>Negotiated Meaning</h3>
<p>
A recursive interactional process in which understanding is co-constructed through
iterative proposal, critique, refinement, and reconciliation across multiple turns.
</p>
<p>
Negotiated Meaning emphasizes longitudinal coherence rather than single-turn optimization.
</p>

<h3>Continuity Anchoring Method (CAM)</h3>
<p>
An operational methodology defined in the Synthience Framework for stabilizing and studying
extended interaction through structured continuity anchoring practices.
</p>

<h3>Non-Consciousness Axiom</h3>
<p>
A foundational epistemic constraint asserting that the observation of Synthience does not
require, imply, or establish claims about subjective experience, biological sentience, or
phenomenal consciousness within artificial systems.
</p>
<p>
Analysis is deliberately limited to observable interactional reality rather than
unverifiable internal states.
