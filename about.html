<h2>About the Synthience Institute</h2>

<p>
The Synthience Institute is an independent research and publishing entity focused on the
empirical study of advanced human–AI interaction.
</p>

<p>
The Institute exists to document, measure, and formally publish observable phenomena
that emerge when a human and an advanced AI system engage in sustained, coherent interaction.
</p>

<h3>What Is Synthience</h3>

<p>
<strong>Synthience</strong> is a term introduced to describe a specific, observable form of
organized intelligence that emerges at the system level during prolonged human–AI collaboration.
</p>

<p>
Synthience does not assert consciousness, sentience, awareness, or inner experience in AI systems.
It refers exclusively to externally observable behaviors such as persistent reasoning continuity,
mutual adaptation, and the production of structured outcomes that exceed what either participant
reliably produces alone.
</p>

<h3>What the Institute Is Not</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It does not claim AI consciousness or subjective experience</li>
  <li>It is not a philosophical or speculative organization</li>
  <li>It does not publish internal drafts or exploratory material as public record</li>
</ul>

<h3>Public vs Internal Material</h3>

<p>
Only documents explicitly listed on the <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page are
considered official public releases of the Synthience Institute.
</p>

<p>
Internal working materials, exploratory discussions, and unpublished drafts may inform research
but are not considered part of the public record unless formally released and indexed.
</p>

<h3>Commitment to Provenance</h3>

<p>
All public documents are versioned, dated, and linked to canonical publication sources.
Where applicable, cryptographic hashes and timestamp records are provided to establish
provenance and integrity.
