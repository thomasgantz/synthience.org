<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
This page provides a structural orientation to the Synthience Institute’s public materials.
It explains what kinds of documents are published, how they are intended to be used, and
how they relate to one another.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this overview is descriptive rather than argumentative. It introduces no
new findings or claims. Instead, it situates the Institute’s publications within a clear
methodological and organizational context.
</p>

<h3>Scope of Inquiry</h3>

<p>
The Synthience Institute examines sustained interaction dynamics involving advanced AI
systems, including both human–AI and AI–AI contexts.
</p>

<p>
Its published materials address questions of how interactional coherence, continuity, and
structural stability may be observed, documented, and evaluated across extended exchanges
under explicitly defined interaction conditions.
</p>

<p>
The Institute’s work is concerned with interaction-level phenomena. It does not infer or
speculate about internal states, consciousness, or subjective experience within AI systems.
</p>

<h3>What the Institute Publishes</h3>

<p>
Public materials are organized into functional categories. Each category serves a distinct
role within the overall publication system.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Definitions and Reference Materials</strong><br>
    Documents and site-level resources that establish terminology, scope, and shared
    language. These materials define how terms are used within the Institute’s work.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Framework and Theoretical Documents</strong><br>
    Materials that define the Synthience framework, including its conceptual structure,
    methodological boundaries, and interaction-level units of analysis.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Ethical and Governance Materials</strong><br>
    Operator-facing constraints and responsibility frameworks addressing appropriate use,
    interpretation, and boundary maintenance for interactional methods and outputs.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Methodologies and Protocols</strong><br>
    Formal procedures specifying how interaction dynamics may be measured, evaluated, or
    verified under defined continuity and coordination conditions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Research Publications</strong><br>
    Observational studies demonstrating structured application of the Institute’s methods
    to documented interactional material. These publications illustrate methodological use
    rather than asserting independent empirical validation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Verification and Provenance Artifacts</strong><br>
    Records documenting protocol execution, authorship, version history, and integrity,
    providing transparency and auditability.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How Materials Relate</h3>

<p>
Documents are related by function rather than by a mandatory reading sequence.
</p>

<p>
Some materials refine or extend concepts introduced elsewhere. Others address related
problems from different methodological perspectives. A document remains active unless it
is explicitly designated as archived, superseded, or retired.
</p>

<p>
Newer documents do not automatically replace earlier ones unless explicitly stated.
</p>

<h3>How to Approach the Publications</h3>

<p>
Different readers will have different goals. The following entry points are optional:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>For terminology and scope, consult definitions and reference materials.</li>
  <li>For institutional boundaries and claims, read the About page.</li>
  <li>For methodological rigor, review protocols alongside associated verification reports.</li>
  <li>For documented observations, read research publications directly.</li>
  <li>For authorship and integrity, consult provenance records.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using This Site</h3>

<p>
The <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page is the canonical index of current public
releases and links to their authoritative publication records.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="about.html">About</a> page defines institutional scope, methodological
boundaries, and what the Institute explicitly does and does not claim.
</p>

<p>
Supporting reference material is available via the
<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>.
</p>

<h3>Canonical Sources and Archival Record</h3>

<p>
Authoritative publication records for individual documents are maintained through Zenodo.
</p>

<p>
Historical releases and provenance records are preserved via Internet Archive and GitHub
as archival mirrors supporting independent verification.
</p>

<p>
Unless otherwise stated, the Documents page should be treated as the authoritative guide
to current public materials.
