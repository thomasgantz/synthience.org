<h2>Publication Overview</h2>

<p>
This page provides a high-level orientation to the Synthience Institute’s public materials.
It is intended for first-time readers who want to understand what kinds of documents are
available, what roles they serve, and how they relate—without requiring immediate
engagement with the full texts.
</p>

<p>
This overview does not introduce new claims, interpretations, or methodologies.
Its purpose is strictly explanatory: to describe how the Institute’s published materials
are organized and how a reader might approach them.
</p>

<h3>What You Are Looking At</h3>

<p>
The Synthience Institute publishes a collection of formally released documents examining
sustained interaction dynamics involving advanced AI systems, including human–AI and
AI–AI contexts.
</p>

<p>
Each document serves a specific function within the overall publication system.
Documents are designed to be read independently, and there is no single required
reading order.
</p>

<h3>Types of Materials</h3>

<p>
Public materials fall into several functional categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Definitions and Reference Materials</strong><br>
    Terminology and reference resources, provided either as formal documents or as
    site-level materials such as glossaries and FAQs.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Conceptual and Theoretical Documents</strong><br>
    Materials describing the Synthience paradigm and its conceptual structure.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Ethical and Governance Materials</strong><br>
    Normative frameworks and guidance addressing responsible application and stewardship.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Methodologies and Protocols</strong><br>
    Formal procedures used to measure, evaluate, or verify interaction dynamics across
    different coordination and continuity conditions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Research Publications</strong><br>
    Observational studies applying methods and concepts to specific interactional contexts.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Reports and Verification Artifacts</strong><br>
    Documents recording the execution of protocols against specific research outputs.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Provenance Records</strong><br>
    Cryptographic and archival records establishing authorship, integrity, and publication
    history.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How Materials Relate</h3>

<p>
Materials are related by function rather than by a mandatory sequence.
</p>

<p>
Some documents refine or extend ideas introduced elsewhere. Others address related
problems from different methodological perspectives. A document remains active unless
it is explicitly designated as archived or superseded.
</p>

<p>
Newer documents do not automatically replace earlier ones.
</p>

<h3>How to Approach the Material</h3>

<p>
Different readers will have different goals. The following are optional entry points:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>To understand terminology and scope, begin with definitions and reference materials.</li>
  <li>To understand institutional boundaries and claims, consult the About page.</li>
  <li>To evaluate methodological rigor, review protocols alongside associated reports.</li>
  <li>To examine documented observations, read research publications directly.</li>
  <li>To verify authorship or integrity, consult provenance records.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where available, concise orientation documents may be recommended as optional starting
points for readers seeking a broad overview.
</p>

<h3>Using This Site</h3>

<p>
The <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page is the canonical index of current public
releases and links to their authoritative publication records.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="about.html">About</a> page explains institutional scope, boundaries,
and what the Institute explicitly does and does not claim.
</p>

<p>
Supporting reference material is available via the
<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>.
</p>

<h3>Canonical Sources</h3>

<p>
Authoritative publication records for individual documents are maintained through Zenodo.
Historical releases and provenance records are preserved via Internet Archive and GitHub
as transparent archival mirrors supporting independent verification.
</p>

<p>
Unless otherwise stated, the Documents page should be treated as the authoritative guide
to current public materials.
