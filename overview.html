<h2>Publication Overview</h2>

<p>
This page provides a high-level orientation to the Synthience Institute’s public
materials. It is intended to help first-time readers understand how the Institute’s
documents are structured and how they relate to one another, without requiring
immediate engagement with the full texts.
</p>

<p>
This overview does not introduce new claims, interpretations, or methodologies.
It restates, at a structural level, how the Institute’s published materials are organized.
</p>

<h3>How the Publications Are Structured</h3>

<p>
The Synthience Institute publishes several distinct classes of documents. Each class
serves a specific role within the overall research and publication system.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Definitions and Foundational Documents</strong><br>
    Public-facing definitions and reference materials that establish terminology and
    shared language.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Paradigm and Theoretical Documents</strong><br>
    Materials that define the Synthience paradigm, conceptual structure, ethical framing,
    and theoretical context.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Methodologies and Protocols</strong><br>
    Formal procedures used to measure, evaluate, or verify aspects of human–AI interaction
    and related research artifacts.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Research Publications</strong><br>
    Empirical studies applying the Institute’s methods to specific interactional contexts.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Reports and Verification Artifacts</strong><br>
    Documents recording the execution of protocols against specific research outputs,
    including citation verification and audit records.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Provenance and Claims of Origin</strong><br>
    Cryptographic records establishing authorship, integrity, version history, and
    publication timestamps.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>On Framework Materials and Document Evolution</h3>

<p>
Early Synthience materials were released as a single merged framework document in order
to establish authorship, integrity, and timestamp priority. That merged document is
preserved as an archival record on the <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Subsequent publications are released and maintained as individual, standalone documents,
each with its own scope, versioning, and publication record.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, newer documents do not automatically supersede earlier ones unless this is
explicitly stated. Some documents represent refinements, extensions, or alternative
approaches rather than replacements. A document is archived only when it is formally
designated as superseded.
</p>

<p>
This allows multiple methodologies or conceptual approaches to coexist where appropriate,
and avoids implying linear or mandatory upgrade paths.
</p>

<h3>How to Use This Site</h3>

<p>
Readers seeking specific research outputs or formal publications should consult the
<a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page, which lists all current public releases and
links to their authoritative publication records.
</p>

<p>
Readers interested in institutional scope, methodological boundaries, and what the
Institute explicitly does and does not claim should consult the
<a href="about.html">About</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Supporting reference material is available via the
<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>.
</p>

<h3>Canonical Sources</h3>

<p>
Authoritative publication records for individual documents are maintained through Zenodo.
Historical releases and provenance records are preserved via Internet Archive and GitHub,
which serve as transparent archival mirrors supporting independent verification.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page should be treated as the canonical index
of current public materials unless otherwise stated.
