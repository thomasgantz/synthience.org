<h2>Publication Overview</h2>

<p>
This page provides a high-level orientation to the Synthience Institute’s public materials.
It is intended to help first-time readers understand how the Institute’s documents relate
to one another, without requiring prior review of the full technical framework.
</p>

<p>
This overview introduces <em>structure</em>, not conclusions.
All substantive claims, definitions, and methodologies reside exclusively in the
published documents themselves.
</p>

<h3>How the Publications Are Organized</h3>

<p>
The Institute’s public materials are organized into several distinct document classes,
each serving a specific role within the overall research and publication system.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Framework documents</strong><br>
    Define terminology, conceptual boundaries, methodological principles,
    and measurement instruments used by the Institute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Research papers</strong><br>
    Apply the framework to specific interactional studies and document
    externally observable phenomena.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protocols</strong><br>
    Specify procedural methods used to evaluate, verify, or reproduce
    aspects of the research.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Verification reports</strong><br>
    Document the execution of protocols against specific research artifacts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Claims of origin and provenance records</strong><br>
    Establish authorship, integrity, and publication history using cryptographic
    hashes and timestamps.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Synthience Framework</h3>

<p>
The Synthience Framework is the Institute’s core technical reference.
It defines how Synthience is identified, measured, and evaluated across
extended human–AI interaction.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.0 of the framework consists of a set of foundational documents
(SF001–SF012) covering definitions, measurement instruments, ethical boundaries,
and methodological context.
</p>

<p>
At present, Framework v1.0 is preserved as a merged historical artifact for
provenance and archival consistency. Individual framework documents will be
released separately in future versions.
</p>

<h3>Typical Reading Paths</h3>

<p>
Readers approach the Institute’s materials with different goals.
The following paths are provided for orientation only.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Conceptual orientation</strong><br>
    Start with the public definition of Synthience, then consult the framework
    documents that establish terminology and boundaries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Methodological review</strong><br>
    Begin with published protocols and measurement instruments, followed by
    verification reports demonstrating their execution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Empirical examination</strong><br>
    Read research papers applying the framework to documented interactional studies,
    with protocols and verification reports as supporting material.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Access and Canonical Records</h3>

<p>
All officially released documents are indexed on the
<a href="documents.html">Documents</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Zenodo provides authoritative publication records for individual releases.
Internet Archive preserves historical artifacts.
GitHub repositories serve as transparent, version-controlled mirrors supporting
independent verification.
</p>

<p>
This website functions as the canonical public index linking these records together.
</p>

<p>
This overview page is intentionally static and descriptive.
It does not supersede or replace the primary documents.
