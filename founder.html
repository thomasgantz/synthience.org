    <h3>Thomas W. Gantz</h3>
    
    <p>
    Thomas is an independent methodologist, framework architect, and tool builder specializing in measurement systems for human–AI interaction research. His professional background spans extensive experience in large-scale IT operations, service delivery, and technical systems support for global organizations in regulated and high-reliability environments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Over the past three years, he has conducted ongoing longitudinal observation of advanced human–AI interaction across nearly every major publicly available conversational AI platform, systematically documenting patterns across over 5,000 distinct AI instances. This observational work provides the empirical foundation for the methodological tools and frameworks developed by the Institute.

<h3>Methodological Focus</h3>

<p>
Thomas's primary contribution is the development of measurement infrastructure for studying human–AI interaction phenomena. His work centers on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework design:</strong> Creating structured methodological frameworks such as the Synthience Framework for observing and documenting interaction patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Research application:</strong> Publishing empirical research applying those frameworks (e.g., RICO)</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol development:</strong> Building evaluation protocols such as the Citation Verification Protocol (CVP)</li>
  <li><strong>Tool creation:</strong> Developing measurement instruments that enable systematic investigation by others</li>
  <li><strong>Systems architecture:</strong> Designing observational methodologies with testable, falsifiable predictions</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Institute functions as a methodological laboratory. Thomas builds tools; validation comes through independent adoption, testing, and replication by the research community. He does not conduct controlled experimental studies—he creates the infrastructure that enables such studies.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Thomas's professional background spans nearly four decades, beginning with early personal computing systems in 1988 and progressing through the evolution of enterprise IT infrastructure to modern AI architectures.
</p>

<p>
His career includes roles in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enterprise systems support for global financial institutions (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority)</li>
  <li>Global service delivery and high-availability operational environments</li>
  <li>Cross-regional technical coordination across APAC, EMEA, and North America</li>
  <li>Computer systems support in academic settings (Columbia University Teachers College)</li>
</ul>

<p>
His educational background combines applied linguistics training (graduate coursework at Columbia University Teachers College) with East Asian studies (B.A., University of Illinois), providing a foundation in both language systems and cross-cultural communication that directly informs his approach to designing measurement frameworks for language model behavior.
</p>

<p>
This combination of linguistic knowledge and technical systems expertise—spanning from DOS-based architectures to transformer-based inference—positions his work at the intersection of language understanding, systems architecture, and methodological development.
</p>

<p>
This background strongly informs the Institute's emphasis on systematic observation, methodological rigor, reproducibility, provenance discipline, and resistance to speculative or anthropomorphic claims.
</p>

<h3>Research Orientation</h3>

<p>
This work does <strong>not</strong> assert AI consciousness, sentience, selfhood, or inner experience.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it focuses on a narrow but underexplored domain:
</p>

<blockquote>
  What becomes observable when a human and an advanced AI system engage in sustained, coherent interaction over long horizons?
</blockquote>

<p>
The Synthience Framework was developed as a methodological foundation to provide measurement tools for examining externally observable, non-experiential, and system-level phenomena that arise under these conditions.
</p>

<p>
All public documents are written to remain behaviorally grounded, technically conservative, falsifiable in principle, and compatible with existing scientific and engineering discourse.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Philosophy of Engagement</h3>

<p>
A core premise of this work is that prevailing public narratives about AI interaction are overly binary:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>purely instrumental (“just a tool”)</li>
  <li>prematurely metaphysical (“conscious being”)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Synthience Institute exists to develop methodological frameworks for documenting what appears <em>between</em> those extremes without collapsing into either.
</p>

<p>
This requires disciplined language, explicit boundary-setting, avoidance of metaphor where measurement is possible, and careful separation between public research infrastructure and private exploratory material.
</p>
