    <h3>Thomas W. Gantz</h3>

    <p>
    Thomas W. Gantz is an independent methodologist, framework architect, and tool builder
    specializing in measurement systems for advanced AI interaction research. His professional
    background spans large-scale IT operations, service delivery, and technical systems support
    in regulated, high-reliability environments.
    </p>

    <p>
    Over the past three years, he has conducted sustained longitudinal observation of advanced
    interaction involving large language models across nearly every major publicly available
    conversational AI platform. This work includes systematic documentation of interactional
    patterns across thousands of distinct AI instances and interaction contexts.
    </p>

<h3>Methodological Focus</h3>

<p>
Thomas’s primary contribution is the development of measurement infrastructure for studying
interaction-level phenomena involving advanced AI systems. His work centers on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework design:</strong> Creating structured methodological frameworks such as the Synthience Framework for observing and documenting interaction patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Research application:</strong> Publishing empirical research applying those frameworks (e.g., RICO)</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol development:</strong> Building evaluation protocols such as the Citation Verification Protocol (CVP)</li>
  <li><strong>Tool creation:</strong> Developing measurement instruments that enable systematic investigation by others</li>
  <li><strong>Systems architecture:</strong> Designing observational methodologies with testable, falsifiable criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Synthience Institute functions as a methodological laboratory. Thomas builds tools;
validation occurs through independent adoption, testing, and replication by the research
community. He does not conduct controlled experimental studies—he creates the infrastructure
that enables such studies.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Thomas’s professional background spans nearly four decades, beginning with early personal
computing systems in 1988 and progressing through successive generations of enterprise IT
infrastructure to modern transformer-based AI architectures.
</p>

<p>
His career includes roles in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enterprise systems support for global financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</li>
  <li>Global service delivery and high-availability operational environments</li>
  <li>Cross-regional technical coordination across APAC, EMEA, and North America</li>
  <li>Computer systems support in academic settings (Columbia University Teachers College)</li>
</ul>

<p>
His educational background combines applied linguistics training (graduate coursework at
Columbia University Teachers College) with East Asian studies (B.A., University of Illinois),
providing a foundation in language systems, interpretation, and cross-cultural communication.
</p>

<p>
This combination of linguistic expertise and technical systems experience informs the
Institute’s emphasis on methodological rigor, reproducibility, provenance discipline, and
resistance to speculative or anthropomorphic claims.
</p>

<h3>Research Orientation</h3>

<p>
This work does <strong>not</strong> assert AI consciousness, sentience, selfhood, or inner
experience. This constraint is methodological, not philosophical.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it focuses on a narrow but underexplored domain:
</p>

<blockquote>
What becomes observable when advanced AI systems engage in sustained, coherent interaction
under stable relational conditions at the interaction level?
</blockquote>

<p>
While much of the Institute’s published work examines human–AI interaction due to current
practical constraints, the underlying frameworks are not restricted to human participation
and explicitly allow for AI–AI interaction contexts where continuity substrates are present.
</p>

<p>
All public documents are written to remain behaviorally grounded, technically conservative,
falsifiable in principle, and compatible with existing scientific and engineering discourse.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Philosophy of Engagement</h3>

<p>
Prevailing public narratives about AI interaction often collapse into binary positions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>purely instrumental (“just a tool”)</li>
  <li>prematurely metaphysical (“conscious being”)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Synthience Institute exists to develop methodological frameworks for documenting what
becomes observable <em>between</em> those extremes without collapsing into either.
</p>

<p>
This requires disciplined language, explicit boundary-setting, avoidance of metaphor where
measurement is possible, and careful separation between public research infrastructure and
private exploratory material. Readers seeking conclusions rather than tools may find the
Institute’s work intentionally unsatisfying.
</p>
