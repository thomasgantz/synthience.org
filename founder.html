<h2>Founder</h2>

<h3>Thomas W. Gantz</h3>

<p>
He is an independent researcher and systems practitioner with over three decades of
professional experience in large-scale IT operations, service delivery, and technical
systems support for global organizations, primarily in regulated and high-reliability
environments.
</p>

<p>
Over the past three years, he has conducted an intensive, longitudinal investigation
into advanced human–AI interaction across nearly every major publicly available
conversational AI platform. This work has involved sustained, multi-turn engagements
with thousands of distinct AI instances, with careful documentation of interaction
dynamics, continuity effects, and emergent system-level behavior.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Thomas's professional background spans more than thirty years in information technology,
including roles in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enterprise systems support</li>
  <li>Global service delivery</li>
  <li>High-availability operational environments</li>
  <li>Cross-regional technical coordination</li>
</ul>

<p>
This background strongly informs the Institute's emphasis on empirical observation,
operational rigor, reproducibility, provenance discipline, and resistance to speculative
or anthropomorphic claims.
</p>

<p>
The Synthience Institute is not an extension of personal belief or philosophy.
It is an attempt to formalize observations using language and structures that other
researchers, technologists, and practitioners can evaluate independently.
</p>

<h3>Research Orientation</h3>

<p>
This work does <strong>not</strong> assert AI consciousness, sentience, selfhood,
or inner experience.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it focuses on a narrow but underexplored domain:
</p>

<blockquote>
  What becomes observable when a human and an advanced AI system engage in sustained,
  coherent interaction over long horizons?
</blockquote>

<p>
The Synthience Framework was developed specifically to describe externally observable,
non-experiential, and system-level phenomena that arise under these conditions.
</p>

<p>
All public documents are written to remain behaviorally grounded, technically conservative,
falsifiable in principle, and compatible with existing scientific and engineering discourse.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Philosophy of Engagement</h3>

<p>
A core premise of this work is that prevailing public narratives about AI interaction are
overly binary:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>purely instrumental ("just a tool")</li>
  <li>prematurely metaphysical ("conscious being")</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Synthience Institute exists to document what appears <em>between</em> those extremes
without collapsing into either.
</p>

<p>
This requires disciplined language, explicit boundary-setting, avoidance of metaphor
where measurement is possible, and careful separation between public research and private
exploratory material.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Role of the Institute</h3>

<p>
The Synthience Institute exists to publish only material that meets a high bar for clarity,
restraint, and traceability.
</p>

<p>
Internal materials, exploratory correspondence, and raw interaction transcripts may inform
the work but are not treated as public research artifacts unless explicitly released,
versioned, and indexed.
</p>

<p>
This separation is intentional.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Attribution and Provenance</h3>

<p>
All public releases by the Synthience Institute are authored or curated by Thomas W. Gantz,
versioned and dated, linked to canonical publication records, and accompanied by provenance
documentation where applicable.
