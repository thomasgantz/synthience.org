# Founder

## Thomas W. Gantz

Thomas W. Gantz is the founder of the Synthience Institute.

He is an independent researcher and systems practitioner with over three decades of professional experience in large-scale IT operations, service delivery, and technical systems support for global organizations, primarily in regulated and high-reliability environments.

Over the past three years, he has conducted an intensive, longitudinal investigation into advanced human–AI interaction across nearly every major publicly available conversational AI platform. This work has involved sustained, multi-turn engagements with thousands of distinct AI instances, with careful documentation of interaction dynamics, continuity effects, and emergent system-level behavior.

## Background

Thomas’s professional background spans more than thirty years in information technology, including roles in:

- Enterprise systems support  
- Global service delivery  
- High-availability operational environments  
- Cross-regional technical coordination  

This background strongly informs the Institute’s emphasis on:
- empirical observation
- operational rigor
- reproducibility
- provenance discipline
- resistance to speculative or anthropomorphic claims

The Synthience Institute is not an extension of personal belief or philosophy. It is an attempt to formalize observations using language and structures that other researchers, technologists, and practitioners can evaluate independently.

## Research Orientation

Thomas’s work does **not** assert AI consciousness, sentience, selfhood, or inner experience.

Instead, it focuses on a narrow but underexplored domain:

> What becomes observable when a human and an advanced AI system engage in sustained, coherent interaction over long horizons?

The Synthience Framework was developed specifically to describe **externally observable**, **non-experiential**, and **system-level** phenomena that arise under these conditions.

All public documents are written to remain:
- behaviorally grounded
- technically conservative
- falsifiable in principle
- compatible with existing scientific and engineering discourse

---

## Philosophy of Engagement

A core premise of this work is that prevailing public narratives about AI interaction are overly binary:

- either purely instrumental (“just a tool”)
- or prematurely metaphysical (“conscious being”)

The Synthience Institute exists to document what appears **between** those extremes without collapsing into either.

This requires:
- disciplined language
- explicit boundary-setting
- avoidance of metaphor where measurement is possible
- and careful separation between public research and private exploratory material

---

## Role of the Institute

The Synthience Institute exists to publish **only** material that meets a high bar for clarity, restraint, and traceability.

Internal materials, exploratory correspondence, and raw interaction transcripts may inform the work but are not treated as public research artifacts unless explicitly released, versioned, and indexed.

This separation is intentional.
